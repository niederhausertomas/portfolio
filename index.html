		<meta name="description" content="I'm a front-end developer with knowledge in several programming languages, including C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. In C++, I completed the first year of the University Degree in Programming at UTNFRGP, where I learned about conditionals (if, else, switch), loops (for, while, and do-while), pointers, functions, vectors, strings, arrays, structs, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including classes, encapsulation, constructors and destructors, this pointer, inheritance, composition, as well as file handling. In HTML and CSS, I have studied at CoderHouse, Devrock School, and complemented my learning with tutorials of Soy Dalto on YouTube. Additionally, I have gained knowledge in JavaScript and React.js through my studies at CoderHouse.">
